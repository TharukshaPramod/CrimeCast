# Crime Prediction Project Summary

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Overview
Successfully built a machine learning system to predict arrest probabilities based on Chicago crime data.

## ðŸ“Š Model Performance
- **Best Model**: XGBoost
- **Accuracy**: 84.9%
- **AUC Score**: 0.748
- **Training Data**: 446,254 records

## ðŸš€ Features Implemented
1. **Real-time predictions** with Streamlit web interface
2. **Multiple ML models** comparison (Random Forest, XGBoost, Logistic Regression, Gradient Boosting)
3. **Interactive data analysis** with Plotly visualizations
4. **Feature importance** analysis
5. **Risk level classification** (Low/Medium/High)

## ðŸ”® Prediction Factors
The model considers 13 features including:
- Location coordinates and police beats
- Temporal factors (time, day, season)
- Geographical areas (district, ward, community area)
- Location types

## ðŸ“ˆ Next Enhancement Ideas
1. Add weather data integration
2. Implement real-time data updates
3. Add more sophisticated spatial analysis
4. Create API endpoints for mobile apps
